# RR Workshop Tutorial: How to use Git with Eclipse

This tutorial in the context of the **Reproducible Research Workshop** provides you with the first steps on how to use Git with the Eclipse IDE. Eclipse is heavily used to program in Java, as well as in other languages like C++, and even Python (via PyDev).

The repository provides you with a step-by-step tutorial, which you are reading right now, and is at the same time the repository you _play_ with to create your first Git project in Eclipse.

**Objectives of this tutorial:**

* Set up and install Eclipse, EGit, and ensure Git is installed
* Clone/fork an existing project from GitHub
* Make some commits to your own project

## Part 1: Installation and setup

To get started you need the following software installed on your computer: [Git](https://git-scm.com), Eclipse, and EGit (TODO: add links). Additionally you will also need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

1. **Git ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)):** Download and Install Git. 
   _Optional Git clients: [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)_.
2. **Eclipse ([Download Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/)):** Download and install Eclipse (if not already installed). (TODO: More instructions needed here, I'll need to test this out as they now have an installer for Windows.)
3. **EGit**: EGit is a plugin for Eclipse which allows you to interface with Git. TODO: installation instructions for EGit, this is done within Eclipse.
4. **GitHub account**: On [GitHub](https://github.com/) create yourself a free GitHub account. _If you are new to Git follow the 15 min [TryGit Tutorial](https://try.github.io) to get a quick introduction to Git._
