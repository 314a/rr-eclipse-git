# RR Workshop Tutorial: How to use Git with Eclipse

This tutorial in the context of the **Reproducible Research Workshop** provides you with the first steps on how to use Git with the Eclipse IDE. Eclipse is heavily used to program in Java, as well as in other languages like C++, and even Python (via PyDev).

The repository provides you with a step-by-step tutorial, which you are reading right now, and is at the same time the repository you _play_ with to create your first Git project in Eclipse.

**Objectives of this tutorial:**

* Set up and install Eclipse, EGit, and ensure Git is installed
* Clone/fork an existing project from GitHub
* Make some commits to your own project
